### ABOUT ###

This is a Linear Algebra exam solver.
In 2016, I was completing Linear Algebra 2 course. As almost every other student on this course, I have solved a couple of tasks with the Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization Algorithm who, after only few iterations, got very ugly numbers. That was a real motivation killer, especially if I've made an error somewhere. To verify the solutions during task solving, I have written a C++ implementation of Gram Schmidt algorithm on various Inner Product Spaces. Later on, I have started to use this codebase as a Math playground for some other concepts.

### How to set up? ###

It was built with Visual Studio 2017, so that will work. There are a couple of ways to use try this project out.
To try out the interface and possibilities it is best to use it from the PlaygroundMain.cpp. Just set the appropriate defines in Platform.hpp and rebuild.

To use it as a console application:
Set define CONSOLE_APP in Platform.hpp to 1 and all other to 0.
After build, add your input in Input directory named "input.txt". There is a builtin input tutorial. Application has no GUI, so input is done with file input.
