### ABOUT ###

This was started back in 2016, while I was completing Linear Algebra 2 course, as a solver for some exam tasks.
I have implemented an algorithm for Gram-Schmidt Orthonomalization to verify the solutions during task solving.
Later on, I have started to use this codebase as a Math playground for some other concepts, implementing algorithms from Numerical mathematics course and similar.

There are 3 targets: playground, app and tests.
Playground has access to whole library to try things out as I develop.
App is a terminal-based wrapper around the library that I made for others to use the algorithm. It could be broken since I have stopped developing it long time ago.
There no dependencies and everything should build on any OS via CMake. However, the app target was only tested on Windows.
